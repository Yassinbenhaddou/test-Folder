## FAQ

### What can I do with this template?

Anything! The scene included is a barebones ARDK setup that can be used in any way you see fit. If you need any ideas or want to get more familiar with what the ARDK provides, check out the [Lightship wesbite](https://lightship.dev/). You can also check out the experiences hosted on [our platform](https://www.loak.co/) to see what us and other people have made with these tools.

### I have questions that aren't answered here.
